# Suggestion Detection Algorithm with Gaussian Naive Bayes and TF-IDF Count Vectorizer

This project implements a suggestion detection algorithm designed to analyze text data and identify user suggestions or recommendations. The algorithm leverages the Gaussian Naive Bayes classification model and utilizes TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) Count Vectorization for feature engineering.

### Key Components and Features:

#### TF-IDF Count Vectorization:

TF-IDF is employed to convert text data into numerical features, effectively capturing the importance of words in the context of the entire dataset. This enhances the model's ability to distinguish suggestions from non-suggestions.

#### Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier:

Gaussian Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classification algorithm used to model the likelihood of a text segment being a suggestion or not, based on the TF-IDF features.

#### Feature Engineering:

Feature engineering is a crucial step in the model's performance. The TF-IDF Count Vectorizer is used to transform text data into a numerical format, enabling the algorithm to learn and make predictions effectively.


### Model Implementation:

Apply TF-IDF Count Vectorization to convert text data into numerical features.

Train the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier using the TF-IDF features and the labeled dataset.
Inference:

Use the trained model to predict whether a given text segment is a suggestion or not.
